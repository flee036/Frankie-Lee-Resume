        He is also considering marketing or finance. After watching his parents grow deeply involved with the aspect of business for many years, he knew at a young age that he wanted to go into business. 
        In high school, Frankie worked as an assistant at a dental office and managed the sales paperwork and was fascinated to see how a successful business was run taking into account the cost effective mentality.
        From this experience, he learned the value of hard work, efficiency, and communication. 
        In the near future, he hopes to continue to study away through the route of business and maybe one day open a successful business just like the Dental Office in San Francisco.
        Frankie spends his spare time playing basketball and making YouTube videos on cars. 
      <br><br>

        Frankie's interest in business has lead him to starting up a Youtube channel in the fall of 2017 garnering over one thousand subscribers as well as approaching a million views. 
        He enjoys making videos as it allows him to work with the aspect of how to run a business.
        Frankie currently creates videos on the topic of lifestyle and automobiles going into the new year and continues to recieve payment from Google.
        Over the summer of 2019, he spent the majority of his time volunteering as well as tutoring students for non-profit.
        After break, Frankie has applied to work at the Student Recreation Center on Riverside Campus and will begin working first thing spring quarter. 
        <br><br>

        Frankie Lee comes from San Francisco, California and graduated from Burlingame High School with honors within his class. At burlingame, Frankie was the Vice-President Awareness Club and team-captain of Track and Field. He also participated in Leadership, Service Commission, and the Student Government.
        He maintained a job part-time during senior year at a local Market until the beginning of his freshmen year of college.
        As a manager, Frankie had learned to utilize the money management skills as well as learn how to take control of different work situations.
        This experience was extremely helpful in shaping the way Frankie has an outlook on life and allowed for him to build character and a deeper interest in business.
